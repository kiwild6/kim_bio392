# Paper: Progenetix oncoenomic resources in 2021


Progenetix is a public cancer genome data resource important for comparison and it also contains many information from external resources and diffrent projects and studies 

The Progentix project curates individual cancer CNA profiles and metadata from diffrent cancer studies 
> CNA = copy number alterations 

> CNV = copy number variation 

Copy number aberrations are present in most cancer types and impact tumor development

CNAs represent a type of nearly ubiquitous and frequently extensive structural genome variations

Over last few years much more data of cancer genomes were collected 


- most important resources/projects: GEO, ArrayExpress, cBioPortal and TCGA 

Trough all this new data/samples ,from diffrent sources, added many new distinct cancer types could be better accessed

In SNP array based experiments also allel specific information and loss of heterozygotosity was added an some information about germline variant landscapes 


Many distinct cancer types were found in diffrent projects according to National Cancer Theasaurus NCIt

NCI Thesaurus (NCIt)is a reference terminology that include the cancer domain, cancer related diseases, findings and abnormalities


- LOH complements the CNV profile with information of allelic loss 
- ICD-O topography system provides organ and substructure specific mapping of a tumor entity 
- UBERON is a cross-species anatomical structural ontology system closely aligned with developmental processes

> API = Application Programming Interface

For each sample geographic point coordination is inclueded and city coordination was created by using GeoNames

You can filter for cancer type, tissue location, morphology, cell line or geo-graphic location
costumized visualization is also possible to select chromosomal regions or a subset of studies




With the help of Progenetix you can detect, that Breast carcinomes show a consistent CNV profile similar to T-cell non-Hodgines lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome and other malignant epethilial tumours 





Example:
Searching for a specific cancer type:

## Conclusion 

Progenetix is a databank which provides a collection of oncogenomic data with a focus on individual genome-wide CNA profiles and topic relevent metadata from many diffrent studies 

Through aggregation of data from many individual research studies all information can be collected in one place and can be easely accesed by everyone
