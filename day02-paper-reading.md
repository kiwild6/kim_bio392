# Paper: Progenetix oncoenomic resources in 2021

Progentix project curates individual cancer CNA profiles and metadata from diffrent cancer studies 
> CNA = copy number alterations 

Over last few years much more data of cancer genomes were collected 

- copy number aberrations are present i most cancer types and impact tumor development 
- Progenetix is a public cancer genome data resource important for comparison
- It also contains many information from external resurces and diffrent projects and studies 

most imprtant resources/projects: GEO, ArrayExpress, cBioPortal and TCGA 

Trough all this new data/samples added many new distinct cancer types could be better accessed

in SNP array based experiments also allel specific information and loss of heterozygotosity was added an some information about germline variant landscapes 

cancer samples have been annotated with a special NCIt term
many distinct cancer types were found in diffrent projects according to National Cancer Theasaurus NCIt
bringing this data together many new nodes where idenified 

breast carcinomes show a consistent CNV profile similar to T-cell non-Hodgines lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome and other malignant 
  epethilial tumours 
LOH complements the CNV profile with information of allelic loss 
a few rominent patterns can then be highligthed 

ICD-O topography system provides organ and substructure specific mapping of a tumor entity 

UBERON is a cross-species anatomical structural ontology system closely aligned with developmental processes

> API = Application Programming Interface

for ech sample geographic point coordination is included 
city coordination was created by using GeoNames

you can filter for cancer type, tissue location, morphology, cell line or geo-graphic location
costumized visualization is also possible to select chromosomal regions or a subset of studies

Example:
Searching for a specific cancer type:

## Conclusion 

Progenetix is a databank which provides a collection of oncogenomic data with a focus on individual genome-wide CNA profiles and topic relevent metadata from many diffrent studies 

Through aggregation of data from many individual research studies all information can be collected in one place and can be easely accesed by everyone
