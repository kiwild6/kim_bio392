# Paper: Progenetix oncoenomic resources in 2021

Progentix project curates individual cancer CNA profiles and metadata from diffrent cancer studies 
Over last few years much more data of cancer genomes were collected 

copy number aberrations are present i most cancer types and impact tumor development 
Progenetix is a public cancer genome data resource important for comparison
It also contains many information from external resurces and diffrent projects and studies 

most imprtant resources/projects: GEO, ArrayExpress, cBioPortal and TCGA 
Trough all this new data/samples added many new distinct cancer types could be better accessed

in SNP array based experiments also allel specific information and loss of heterozygotosity was added
information about germline variant landscapes 

cancer samples have been annotated with a special NCIt term 
bringing this data together many new nodes where idenified 

breast carcinomes show a consistent CNV profile similar to T-cell non-Hodgines lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome and other malignant 
  epethilial tumours 
LOH complements the CNV profile with information of allelic loss 
a few rominent patterns can then be highligthed
